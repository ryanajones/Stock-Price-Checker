# Stock Price Checker
> This web application is a Nasdaq stock price checker. The user can utilize the UI to enter which stock to see the price of, or alternatively, use the URL path and query parameters to request the information. As an added bonus to showcase skills of database usage, the user has the option to like the stock. Stock likes are recorded according to each user's IP address, so they can only like it one time. The JSON response will show current stock price and how many likes it has collected from this specific application. Another capability of this app is to compute two different stock entries at the same time, which in turn will show their current stock price and relative likes between the two. Node.js and Express.js are used to handle the stock GET requests. Mongoose.js is used make communication between Node and MongoDB easier for the database portion of the app. JQuery is used to handle the front-end form requests and to display the JSON response. The Chai and Mocha testing libraries are used for function testing.
